# case-basedosdados
Visualization case for Base dos Dados' data analyst technical test.

- Here I explore an old curiosity of mine: 
  - [Is there a relatioship between forest area and suicide incidence?](notebooks/1_case_suicide_forest.ipynb) Well, apperently not (yey science!). 

  - 🇧🇷 (PT-BR): [Existe alguma relação entre área de mata e incidência de suicídio nos municípios brasileiros?](notebooks/br_municipios_suicidio_floresta_20220824.ipynb) (não tem).
